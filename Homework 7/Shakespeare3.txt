Clown: Why masters, have your instruments been in
Naples, that they speak i' th' nose thus?
Musician: How, sir, how?
Clown: Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
Musician: Ay, marry, are they, sir.
Clown: O, thereby hangs a tail.
Musician: Whereby hangs a tail, sir?
Clown: Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I
know. But, masters, here's money for you; and the
General so likes your music that he desires you, for
love's sake, to make no more noise with it.
