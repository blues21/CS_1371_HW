Jane S., a chief sub editor and editor, can always be found
hard at work in her cubicle. Jane works independently, without
wasting company time talking to colleagues. She never
thinks twice about assisting fellow employees, and she always
finishes given assignments on time. Often Jane takes extended
measures to complete her work, sometimes skipping
coffee breaks. She is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no
vanity in spite of her high accomplishments and profound
knowledge in her field. I firmly believe that Jane can be
classed as a high-caliber employee, the type which cannot be
dispensed with. Consequently, I duly recommend that Jane be
promoted to executive management, and a proposal will be
sent away as soon as possible.
