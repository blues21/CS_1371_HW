Jane S., a chief sub editor and editor, can always be found
wasting company time talking to colleagues. She never
finishes given assignments on time. Often Jane takes extended
coffee breaks. She is a dedicated individual who has absolutely no
knowledge in her field. I firmly believe that Jane can be
dispensed with. Consequently, I duly recommend that Jane be
sent away as soon as possible.
