Burdell is a campus icon, and his name 
is revered among the students on campus.[19][20] Incoming 
freshmen are introduced to him as one of 
the greatest alumni to graduate from the school. 
George P. Burdell is often paged by first 
year marching band students during football games and 
also at airports, bars, and hotels. Georgia Tech 
students or alumni often use his name as 
an alias when they do not want to 
disclose their real name.[21] There is a store 
in Georgia Tech's student center named "Burdell's," pictured 
above.[22]
