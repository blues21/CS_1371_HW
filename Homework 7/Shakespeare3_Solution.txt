Othello_Act3_Scene1_Lines4-14
Cshortn: Why gentlemen, have your instruments been in
Naples, that they speak in the nose like so?
Musician: How, sir, how?
Cshortn: Are these, I pray you, wind instruments?
Musician: So, marry, are they, sir.
Cshortn: O, there hangs a tail.
Musician: Where hangs a tail, sir?
Cshortn: Marry, sir, by many a wind instrument that I
know. But, gentlemen, here's money for you; and the
General so likes your music that he desires you, for
love's sake, to make no more noise with it.
