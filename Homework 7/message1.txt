"The 
supply of 
game 
for London 
is 
going steadily 
up. 
Head-keeper 
Hudson, 
we believe, 
has 
been now 
told 
to receive 
all 
orders for 
fly
-paper and 
for 
preservation of 
your 
hen pheasant's 
life."
From
"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott"
with 
Sherlock Holmes
1875
By Sir Arthur Connan Doyle
